    <!-- HOW TO USE THIS FILE -->

    <!-- 1. In the <info> section, set your module name and revision -->
    <!-- 2. The configurations listed in the <dependencies> section  -->
    <!--    are the standard ones that map to Maven dependencies. If -->
    <!--    you have a dependency that doesn't match any of these,   -->
    <!--    then feel free to define your own. However, set the      -->
    <!--    visibility to "private" to prevent them from appearing   -->
    <!--    in the pom.xml that we generate.                         -->
    <!-- 3. The "conf" parameter is mapping the Ivy dependency to    -->
    <!--    Maven dependency. Use "default", or as the Maven depend- -->
    <!--    ency or you'll also include javadocs and source.         -->
    <!-- 4. You can map a dependency to multiple configurations.     -->
    <!--    However, you need to separate them with a semicolon (;)  -->
    <!--    and not a comma (,):                                     -->
    <!--    Incorrect: conf="compile->default,test->default"         -->
    <!--    Correct:   conf="compile->default;test->default"         -->

    <!-- These "configurations" will map to the correct Maven scopes -->
    <!-- when the pom.xml file is generated. It is advisable to use  -->
    <!-- these in your program. However, you can define your own     -->
    <!-- configurations if none of these work for you. For example,  -->
    <!-- you have a jar that contains a process you use as part of   -->
    <!-- the build process, or a jar that contains ant tasks. Just   -->
    <!-- be sure to define the "visibility" of your defined confs    -->
    <!-- to "private", so the pom.xml doesn't pick them up.          -->
